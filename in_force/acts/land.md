### Section 4: Rural Townships

#### Paragraph 1: Creation
All rural zoned post-declaration land (RZPDL) shall be sectioned off into Townships, starting from the extreme south-west of the territory, extending eastward, then north, so that the last Township is the extreme north-east of the territory.

#### Paragraph 2: Division
Townships are divided into 25 separate plots of land in a 5 by 5 pattern.

#### Paragraph 3: Size
Each plot in a township is 0.01° by 0.01° (about 1.18573 square kilometers).

#### Paragraph 4: Township Councils
1. Each Township has a Township Council, which coordinates the relevant responsibilities of local government on behalf of the Township.
2. Township Councils have elections each year for members.
3. Landowners have votes in Township Council elections based on their share of the land of that Township. However, after a Township has surpassed a population of 100, this converts into 1 equal vote per resident and landowner for the Township Council election.
4. The number of members in a Township Council is equal to the square root of the number of residents and landowners in that Township rounded up to the nearest whole number.

#### Paragraph 5: Names
1. Plots have 2 types of names: their coordinate-based name (CBN) and designated name (DN).
2. The CBN of the first plot (the extreme south-west) is 1-1. The first digit number refers to the north-south position, the last digit refers to the west-east position. The CBN of the last plot (the extreme north-east) is 200-500.
  1. 1st coordinate (north-south) of north-east extreme: -17+0.01•X
  2. 2nd coordinate (west-east) of north-east extreme: 135+0.01•X
  3. 1st number (north-south) of north-east extreme: (X+17)/0.01
  4. 2nd number (west-east) of north-east extreme: (X-135)/0.01
4. There are 4,000 theoretical Townships and 100,000 theoretical plots in Lumina, but thousands are in water.
5. DNs may be designated by a Township Council and must be registered with Lumina Land.

#### Paragraph 6: Public Routes
Public routes are Government-owned sections on the borders of all plots measuring 8 meters in width. Public routes subtract from the privately-owned size of plots.

#### Paragraph 5: Subdivision
Rural plots may be subdivided after the land owner requests and Lumina Land approves of the change and creates a new plot.

### Section 5: City Districts

#### Paragraph 1: Creation
All city zoned post-declaration land (CZPDL) shall be sectioned off into Districts.

#### Paragraph 4: District Councils

2. District Councils have elections each year for members.
