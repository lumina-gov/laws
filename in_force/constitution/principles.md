## Division 1: Preamble
The citizens of Lumina, having democratically resolved to join together into a mutual pact of defense and protection through the Government of Lumina ("Government") in order to protect human rights, maintain defense and security, and protect the democratic and social systems, do hereby create the Government of Lumina and authorize the Constitutional acts as its foundational law and to authorize the creation of new acts and policies based on the democratic will of the people through the democratically run and organized institutions of the Government.

## Division 2: Purposes

### Section 1: The Constitution

The purpose of the Constitution is to:

1. Establish the existence of the Government, which shall act as the government for the City and Special Economic Zone of Lumina.
2. Outline the structure, function, and powers of the government.
3. Create the Assembly, which is the basis of the citizens' power over the government.
4. Create the ministerial system, established to apply the laws authorized by the Assembly.
5. Create the courts system, established to interpet the laws and administer justice.

### Section 2: The Government

#### Paragraph 1: Post-Scarcity
The Government shall work for the creation of post-scarcity universal entitlement to certain necessary services, which shall be subsidized and promoted by the Government by the provision of free or affordable public services or appropriate regulation under the democratic will of the people, including but not limited to the following fields:
* Shelter
* Healthcare
* Staple foods
* Internet

#### Paragraph 2: Community-Government
Traditional governments simultaneously claim to represent the entirety of the people of the state while limiting direct democratic authority. Understanding the traditional dialectic of the state representing elite rule and the community representing the people, the Government is of the people in the sense that it works to resolve any distinction between the community and the Government, with the hope of limiting the use of protests as a means of resolving problems while respecting the right to free expression and protest.
