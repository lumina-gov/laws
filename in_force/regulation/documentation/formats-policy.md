# Lumina Policy Formats
For all purposes of policy writing, the following standards apply:
1. Policy is divided into the following subdivisions, from highest class to lowest, within a specific act:
    1. Part or Division (D)
    2. Section (§)
    3. Segment (S)
    4. Paragraph (P)
    5. Clause (C)
2. Policy is divided into the following types, from highest authority to lowest, pursuant to Constitution Act D3 §3:
    1. Protected Acts
    2. Acts
    3. Regulations
    4. Directives (no enforcability)
3. Referring to policy (a shorthand way to mention a specific subdivision of a policy) shall include all relevant subdivisions of the policy from lowest to highest specificity separated by a space with the number of that subdivision included after the character representing the subdivision type. For instance, if Paragraph 3 of Section 2 of Division 3 of the Constitution Act nneeds to be referenced, the proper identification would be: `Constitution Act D3 §2 P3`.
4. Citing policy should be done as follows:
    1. Include the italicized act or subdivision reference followed by a period.
    2. Include the publisher: "Lumina Documentation Policy Department".
    3. Date last changed, in the format `Day Month Year`, for instance: 30 March 2022.
    4. Date accessed, in the format `Accessed Day Month Year`.
    5. For instance, on 1 April 2022, if someone would like to cite Constitution Act D3 §2 P3 assuming it was last edited on 30 March 2022, the following would be the appropriate citation: *Constitution Act D3 §2 P3*. Lumina Documentation Policy Department. 30 March 2022. Accessed 1 April 2022.
